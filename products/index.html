              <div class="description">Released in 1997, after the Beanie Babies craze had already hit, Princess the Bear was not part of the original collection. However, Princess the Bear, a purple bear with a white rose embroidered on its chest, was intended to be a fundraising model for The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. Because of its rarity, the Princess the Bear Beanie baby model is considered to be the most expensive and valuable Beanie Baby, with some going for almost $500,000 US dollars on eBay in 2017. Any collector would tell you that Princess the Bear is the Holy Grail of their Beanie Baby collection, and those who donâ€™t own one would do anything to get one.</div>
